SkillCraft Technology Data Science Task 1 – Visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using bar charts and histograms.

This repository contains my first task as part of the Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.  
The objective of this task was to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

Objective
- Analyze Indian population distribution across different age groups.  
- Compare districts based on **Population (in Millions)** and **Literacy Percentage**.  
- Build interactive dashboards using Power BI

Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)  
- Power BI (Dashboard Creation & Visualization)

Contents
- `Indian_Population.xlsx` → Raw dataset.  
- `Indian_Population.pbix` → Power BI project file.
- `Indian_Population_Dashboard_ScreenShot.png` → PNG exports of dashboards.

Dashboard Insights
1. Page_1: Age Group Distribution
   - Categorized into **0–20 years, 21–64 years, 65+ years**.  
   - Visualized using bar + area charts to show India’s demographic spread.
  
2. Page 2: District-Level Insights
   - Population shown in **Millions** (Top districts).  
   - Literacy shown as **Percentage by District** (Top districts).  
   - Interactive slicer to filter by State.

Knowledge Gained
- Difference between **categorical vs continuous variables**.  
- Importance of using **averages for percentages**.  
- Data modeling in Power BI (custom measures, Top N filters, slicers).  
- Designing dashboards that are both accurate and user-friendly.
